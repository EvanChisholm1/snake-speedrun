# Snake Speedrun

A fun little implementation of snake trying to write it as fast as possible. Probably pretty buggy, but it does work.

Final Time: ~25 mins

## lessons learned

-   use shorter variable names
-   don't use typescript, will just slow you down beacuse you have to manually type things, the autocomplete doesn't make up for it
